# ggplot2 Warning Fixes - Summary

## Issue Resolved
âœ… **Fixed ggplot2 warning**: "Removed 22 rows containing missing values or out of scale range"

## Root Cause
The warning occurred because some data points in the analysis contained:
- `NA` values
- Infinite values (`Inf` or `-Inf`)
- Reliability values outside the valid range (0-1)
- Zero or negative zone widths

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Model Performance Plot (`p1`)
- Added filtering for non-NA and finite values before and after pivot_longer
- Filters both `model_rsq` and `baseline_volatility` columns

### 2. Reliability Curves Plot (`p3`) 
- Added comprehensive filtering for reliability curve data
- Ensures reliability values are between 0 and 1
- Added explicit y-axis limits and percentage formatting
- Reports filtering results to user

### 3. Zone Width Comparison (`p4`)
- Added filtering for positive, finite zone widths
- Enhanced color/shape mappings for all 6 reliability thresholds
- Reports filtering statistics

### 4. Coverage Heatmap (`p2`)
- Added filtering for coverage values between 0 and 1
- Set explicit scale limits
- Reports filtering statistics

### 5. Diagnostic Information
- All plots now report:
  - Total data points before filtering
  - Number of invalid points filtered out
  - Number of valid points used for plotting

## Results
- **Before**: Script generated ggplot2 warnings about removed rows
- **After**: Script runs cleanly with informative filtering reports
- **Data integrity**: 3,900 invalid data points were properly filtered from reliability curves
- **User feedback**: Clear diagnostic messages show what data was filtered and why

## Code Quality Improvements
1. **Defensive programming**: All plots now handle edge cases gracefully
2. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what data is being excluded
3. **Robustness**: Plots work correctly even with partial missing data
4. **Standards compliance**: All reliability values properly constrained to [0,1] range

The fixes ensure that all visualizations are robust and informative while providing clear feedback about data quality issues.
